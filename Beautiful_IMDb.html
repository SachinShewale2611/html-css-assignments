    Beautiful IMDb
People are bored with the original movie detail page of IMDb- https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241527/. You want to update a section for them and make it more beautiful.
Some mandatory styles are mentioned below. You can choose to add more to make it more beautiful.
1. the poster for the movie has to be in img tag and should have the following CSS properties:
- height
- width
- opacity
2. The description of the movie should be in p tag in the center of the page using the following CSS:
- position
- - top:
- - width:
- text-align
- font-size

Use class selector for CSS with moviePic for img tag and movieDetail for p tag
Note: Don't use inline CSS
Note: It'd be a good idea to read about the position property. -->
